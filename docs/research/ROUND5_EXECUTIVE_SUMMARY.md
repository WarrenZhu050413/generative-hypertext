## Critical Gaps Identified (Must Fix Immediately)

### P0 - CRITICAL (Week 1)

**1. Backlinks Panel** (0.5 days)
- **Why**: Universal in ALL PKM systems (Roam, Obsidian, Logseq, Reflect, RemNote)
- **Impact**: Users from PKM tools will immediately ask for this
- **Status**: BLOCKER for PKM user adoption

**2. Storage Quota Monitoring** (0.25 days)
- **Why**: Prevent user data loss (Manifest V3 best practice)
- **Impact**: Critical reliability feature
- **Status**: Foundation feature

**3. setTimeout/setInterval Audit** (0.25 days)
- **Why**: Manifest V3 compliance (service workers can terminate)
- **Impact**: Replace with chrome.alarms if found
- **Status**: Technical debt cleanup

---

## High-Value Opportunities (Week 2-3)

### TIME-SENSITIVE: Pocket Migration Campaign

**Opportunity**: Pocket shutting down July 2025, millions of users need alternative

**Implementation**: Pocket Import Tool (2 days)
- Parse Pocket export JSON
- Fetch article content
- Create cards with timestamps + tags
- One-click bulk import

**Marketing**: "Pocket is shutting down - migrate to NabokovsWeb in one click"

**Timeline**: URGENT - Build before July 2025 deadline

---

### Graph View (3-4 days)

**Why**: Standard feature in PKM systems (Obsidian/Logseq/Roam all have this)

**Implementation**: Cytoscape.js (validated in Round 4)
- Toggle between Canvas ↔ Graph views
- Force-directed layout (reveals clusters)
- Click node → navigate to card
- Detect disconnected islands

**Impact**: Expected feature from PKM users, alternative exploration mode

---

### Article Simplification (1 day)

**Why**: Better capture quality → better LLM input → better outputs

**Implementation**: Mozilla Readability library (industry standard)
- Auto-simplify articles on capture
- Toggle in settings
- Clean HTML for LLM processing

**Impact**: Matches Pocket/Instapaper quality, improves AI features

---

## Competitive Positioning

### What NabokovsWeb Does Uniquely

1. **Element-Level Web Capture** → No competitor offers this granularity
2. **Spatial-First Paradigm** → Different from outline-based PKM tools
3. **Connection-Based Synthesis** → LLM generates from connected cards (no competitor has this)
4. **Local-First + AI** → Privacy + generative power (rare combination)
5. **Free Forever** → No subscription pressure

### What We Borrow from Competitors

**From PKM Systems (Obsidian/Logseq)**:
- ✅ Backlinks panel (must implement)
- ✅ Graph view (must implement)
- ✅ Markdown import/export (nice to have)

**From Web Clippers (Pocket/Instapaper)**:
- ✅ Article simplification (Mozilla Readability)
- ✅ Import tools (migration campaigns)

**From Collaboration Tools (Miro/Mural)**:
- ✅ Workspace templates (onboarding)
- ❌ Real-time collaboration (out of scope)

## Summary

### What We Learned (5 Rounds, 36 Searches)

**Round 1**: Spatial hypertext + LLMs is unexplored territory
**Round 2**: Information foraging systems exist, but lack spatial + generative
**Round 3**: PKM systems have graph features, but manual entry only
**Round 4**: Technical infrastructure validated (React Flow, Cytoscape.js, embeddings)
**Round 5**: No direct competitors, unique market position confirmed

### Critical Next Steps

1. **Week 1**: Implement P0 features (backlinks, quota, audit)
2. **Week 2**: Build Pocket import (TIME-SENSITIVE)
3. **Week 3**: Graph view + article simplification
4. **Month 2**: Launch migration campaigns
5. **Month 3-4**: User study preparation
6. **Month 6**: Paper submission

### Competitive Position

**Unique**: Element-level capture + Spatial thinking + LLM generation + Local-first + Free

**Moats**: Technical (web capture), paradigmatic (spatial-first), economic (no subscription)

**Threats**: Low (no direct competitors identified, first-mover advantage)

**Opportunities**: High (Pocket migration, PKM user base, ChatGPT frustration)

---

**Status**: Research phase COMPLETE, implementation phase BEGINS

**Next Action**: Implement backlinks panel (Day 1, 0.5 days)
