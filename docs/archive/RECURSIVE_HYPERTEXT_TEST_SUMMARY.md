# Recursive Hypertext - Quick Test Summary

**Overall Grade**: B (80%) - Major features work, 2 bugs need fixing

## Test Results: 5/7 PASS (71.4%)

### PASSING TESTS
1. Basic Nesting - Parent detection, child creation, z-index stacking
2. Auto-Pin Behavior - Parent auto-pins when child created
3. Z-Index Persistence - Parent stays below child when clicked
4. Depth Limiting - Nesting level tracking works
5. Regression Check - Non-nested hypertext unaffected

### FAILING TESTS
6. Pin State Restoration - Parent doesn't unpin when child closes
7. Cascade Delete - Closing parent doesn't close children

---

## Bugs Identified

### Bug #1: Pin State Restoration (MEDIUM severity)
**Location**: `hypertext/hypertext-experience.js` lines 2176-2193
**Issue**: Console logs "Restored parent pin state" but parent stays pinned
**Fix**: Ensure `session.isPinned = false` is set before calling `controller.setPinned(false)`

### Bug #2: Cascade Delete (HIGH severity)
**Location**: `hypertext/hypertext-experience.js` lines 2168-2174
**Issue**: Closing parent doesn't close children, both tooltips remain
**Fix**: Debug why `closeChat({ force: true, sessionId: childId })` isn't working

---

## What Works Perfectly
- Parent tooltip detection when selecting inside tooltip
- Child z-index = Parent z-index + 1 (verified: 2147483003 = 2147483002 + 1)
- Auto-pin prevents parent from closing while child exists
- Clicking parent doesn't make it jump above child
- Console messages appear correctly
- No regressions in existing features

## Evidence

### Z-Index Verification
```
Level 0: zIndex = 2147483002
Level 1: zIndex = 2147483003 (parent + 1) ✓
Click parent → zIndexes unchanged ✓
```

### Console Output
```
[Hypertext] Auto-pinned parent tooltip ✓
[Hypertext] Restored parent pin state (unpinned) ✓ (but state doesn't actually change)
```

## Recommended Actions

**BEFORE MERGING**:
1. Fix Bug #1 (pin state restoration)
2. Fix Bug #2 (cascade delete)
3. Re-run tests to verify fixes

**OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS**:
- Add depth visualization (5 nested levels)
- Performance testing with max nesting
- Add telemetry for usage patterns
