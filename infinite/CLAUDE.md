- Look into memory.md for what happened previously. YOU SHOULD NEVER END YOUR CHAT. YOU SHOULD NEVER END YOUR RESPONSE AND THINKING!
- I want you to continously go online to
  do literature review to advance the current system. I want you to have two agents:
  1. search agent, and 2. thinking agent, and you will be continuously using them to
  help you search and process the results of your thinking. I want you to note down
  interesting observations in memory.md, and all the possible new features and TODOs
  in features.md.
