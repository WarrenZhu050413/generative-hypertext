### Setup
1. Open any webpage (e.g., https://example.com)
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+C` to open inline chat window
3. Prepare a test image file (PNG or JPEG) on your desktop

### Test Case 1.1: Drag Image into Content Area

- [ ] **Expected**: No image upload triggered
- [ ] **Expected**: Header remains draggable

### Test Case 1.3: Multiple Images

## Test 2: Canvas Image Drop (Regression Check)

- [ ] **Expected**: "üñºÔ∏è Drop images here" overlay appears
- [ ] Drop the image
- [ ] **Expected**: New card created with image

- [ ] **Expected**: Image preview shows correctly
- [ ] **Expected**: No crashes or errors

### Test Case 3.2: Multiple Windows Open
- [ ] Open inline chat on one page
- [ ] Open Canvas in another tab
- [ ] Drag images into both
- [ ] **Expected**: Each window handles drops independently
- [ ] **Expected**: No conflicts or shared state issues

### Test Case 3.3: Rapid Drag Events
- [ ] Drag image in and out of window rapidly (without dropping)
- [ ] **Expected**: Overlay appears/disappears smoothly
- [ ] **Expected**: No flickering or state issues

## Test 4: Console Verification

### Open DevTools Console
- [ ] No errors related to image drop
- [ ] Look for these logs when dropping image:
  ```
  [InlineChatWindow] Processing image: <filename>
  [InlineChatWindow] Image added to pending: {width: X, height: Y}
  ```
- [ ] When sending message with image:
  ```
  [InlineChatWindow] Sending multimodal message with 1 images
  ```

## Known Limitations (Expected Behavior)

1. **Playwright Tests**: Cannot test actual file drag-drop due to security restrictions
2. **Browser Default**: Our fix relies on `preventDefault()` executing before browser sees the drop event
3. **File Picker**: Not yet implemented for InlineChatWindow (only drag-drop works)

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **PASS**: All test cases marked with checkboxes completed successfully

‚ùå **FAIL**: Any of these occur:
- Browser opens image in new tab when dropping
- Drag overlay doesn't appear
- Window header is not draggable
- Images don't appear in preview
- Console shows errors

## If Tests Fail

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify extension reloaded after build
3. Try hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)
4. Check that build completed without warnings
5. Review implementation in `src/components/InlineChatWindow.tsx`:
   - Lines 120-155: Drag event handlers
   - Lines 357-371: Content wrapper with handlers
   - Lines 874-899: Drag overlay styles
